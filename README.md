 API explorer of Your project is hosted online therefore search engines like google/bing can index them.

## What is DNDocs?
DNDocs (Dot Net Docs) is a free documentation hosting platform for .NET projects

## Problem: Host .NET API Documentation 
There is not effortless way to create and host API documentation for .NET Core projects.
Current tools requires to integrate with build and publishing process to maintain docs up-to-date

## When I should use DNDocs?
You don't have any API Explorer for Your .NET project and want to host it in one minute -> use DNDocs

## Motivation
Looking on github C# repositories lots of them did  not have any documentation online. To take a look on basic project structure
and what methods are exposed we needed to open open each .cs file just to simply look what functions and methods are there.
Also there was not any website that allows to just simply generate and host documentation for .NET Core project online.

## Share with URL
Url to documentation can be shared in any form, for example:
1. Put dndocs API Explorer URL to github project README 
2. Generate shields.io badge with Project API Explorer, for example: [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/API%20Docs-DNDocs-190088?logo=readme&logoColor=white)]( https://docs.dndocs.com/n/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore/8.0.3/api/index.html) _(look below in this document for 'shields.io badge informations' to see how to generate exactly same badge)_
3. Or anything other
